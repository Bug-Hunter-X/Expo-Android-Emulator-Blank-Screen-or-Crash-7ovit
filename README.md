# Expo Android Emulator Blank Screen or Crash

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered while using Expo CLI for Android development. The Android emulator fails to start, displaying a blank screen or crashing without providing detailed error messages. The project builds successfully for iOS. 

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified example of an Expo project that exhibits this problem (Note: the actual cause of the issue may not be directly present in the sample code, as it is likely an environment-related problem).  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a range of potential troubleshooting steps and solutions that may help resolve this error, including cleaning the cache, updating Expo CLI, and checking the emulator settings. 

## Troubleshooting steps in bugSolution.js

1. **Cleaning the cache:** This step often addresses issues related to corrupted cached files. 
2. **Updating Expo CLI:**  An outdated Expo CLI might cause compatibility problems with the Android emulator. 
3. **Checking emulator settings:** Ensure the AVD (Android Virtual Device) is configured correctly and has sufficient resources allocated. 
4. **Reinstalling Expo Go:** A corrupted installation of Expo Go could be responsible for the issue. 
5. **Inspecting logs:** Closely reviewing the Android emulator logs may reveal hidden error messages.
6. **Checking Android SDK Setup:** Ensure that all of the necessary Android SDK components are properly installed and configured.
