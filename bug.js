While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the Android emulator wouldn't start, showing a blank screen or crashing immediately after launch.  The Expo Go app wouldn't install, and I couldn't find any detailed error messages in the logs.  I tried restarting my computer, reinstalling the emulator, and verifying my Android SDK setup, but none of these steps resolved the issue.  The project builds fine for iOS.
